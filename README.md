## Project Overview
This project involves scraping all products from the popular Kenyan e-commerce site Jumia. The project generally aims to identify general patterns of the listed products including price distribution, discount distribution, rating distribution, popular names in product labels, & relationships between all the numerical columns. 


## Installation

### Installation Step 1 - Clone project
Clone this project into your desired local machine folder as below: 
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:mutumagitonga/Jumia-WebScrape-Hackathon.git
```
Instead if ssh authentication is not already setup, use the method below: 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mutumagitonga/Jumia-WebScrape-Hackathon.git
```
### Installation Step 2 - Check python version
Before proceeding to the next stage, ensure python's installed in your machine, in any of the 3 platforms - Linux, Windows, or MacOS. Run the command `python -V` in your terminal to check python version - it should be returned if Python installed properly otherwise Python is not installed or there's a problem with your Python installation.

NB: Ensure you have Python 3.3 or above installed.

If Python is not installed, [click here](https://tinyurl.com/43k9evvv) for installation instructions for any of the 3 platforms. 

### Installation Step 3 - Install the virtual environment
Once that's cleared, install a virtual python environment within the cloned project folder:
```bash
  python3 -m venv my_env
```
In the above codeline, you can replace `my_env` with a name of your own for the virtual environment. 

**Purpose of virtual environment:** Isolates a project's dependencies (to be installed) from other projects and the system-wide Python installation. In other words, it contains:  
- A Python interpreter.
- A Python standard library.
- The 3rd party packages(to be installed).

### Installation Step 4 - Activating the virtual environment

On Windows: `my_env\Scripts\activate`

On MacOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

Once activated, the terminal path indicator changes indicating the virtual environment is now active. 

Still, one can confirm the activated virtual environment by running the command `which python` which displays a path to the python executable in the virtual environment. 


### Installation Step 5 - Installing dependencies in requirements.txt
With the virtual environment ready, it's time to install libraries (dependencies) in the requirements.txt file.

The command is shown below: 
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The -r flag instructs pip package manager to read requirements from a file instead of taking a package name argument on the commandline. 

As the command runs, it downloads and installs the required packages in the virtual environment `my_env`

Once done with the project work, the virtual environment can be deactivated by running the command: `deactivate` and when work resumes, one can reactivate it as described in installation step 4. 


    
## Data
### Source Data
The source data in this project was a webscrape of various products available on the Jumia website available progressively pagewise via this [link](https://www.jumia.co.ke/all-products/?page=1) from the 1st to the last page. 

Visiting the link above reveals that every product has 5 critical features - name, old price, new price, discount, rating, and votes. These 5 features constitute the data attributes of the dataframe.


### Data Acquisition 

Raw data is acquired via web scraping. The target website is a popular Kenyan online retailer Jumia. 

**NB:** The following data acquisition procedure is explained as exhaustively as possible to allow quick replication of the process. However, if any problems are encountered, run the cells in the jupyter notebook `notebooks/1_jumia_webscrape.ipynb` consecutively for clarification.  

Before scraping running the scrape, important libraries are imported into the Jupyter notebook as seen below: 
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from collections import Counter
import os
import time

import scripts.gemini_api_call as gemini_call
from scripts import scraper
import importlib
```

Therefore, the first step is visiting the root url of the website, `https://www.jumia.co.ke/` and exploring further to discover the location of the products' endpoint. 

Keen exploration reveals that the endpoint of interest is `https://www.jumia.co.ke/all-products/`. However, a query string, `?page=`, is appended to this endpoint to make the scraping practical (so that its done pagewise). 

Thus, the url becomes `https://www.jumia.co.ke/all-products/?page=`. So one uses the navigation tabs at the bottom of the page to discover the last page, in this case the total page count is found to be 50.   

Now the scraping technique involves employing a for-loop within which page numbers are appended at the end of the query string consecutively. An IF-condition check is done to ensure the scraping is only done when the products are absent (to prevent repeat scraping).  
```python
# Declare the productsâ€™ url & the total webpage count
other_pages_url = "https://www.jumia.co.ke/all-products/?page="
webpage_num_total = 50

# If scraped products csv doesn't exist, run the scraper function below & save products to csv ELSE continue & read csv
if not os.path.exists('../data/raw/all_products_list_raw.csv'):
    for page in range(1, webpage_num_total+1, 1):
        other_pages_url = "https://www.jumia.co.ke/all-products/?page="
        page = str(page)
        other_pages_url = other_pages_url + page
        # Fetching HTML data
        response = scraper.fetch_html_data(other_pages_url)
        # Converting to soup object
        soup = scraper.convert_web_data_to_beautiful_soup_obj(response)
        # Appending each product dictionary to all_products list
        append_one_product_details_dictionary_to_list(page)
    
    # Convert scraped list to dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame(all_products_list)
    # Save scraped dataframe to csv to prevent scraping each time I run the notebook
    df.to_csv('../data/raw/all_products_list_raw.csv')
```
**NB:** The last 2 lines of the code snippet above run after all the product pages have been scraped. The 2nd last line creates a pandas dataframe from the list of products' data attributes dictionaries while the last line saves the dataframe as a csv. The csv file is saved once to store the scraped data thus preventing the scraper from re-running each time the entire notebook is run.  

For each page, the url is passed to a function fetching the html data which is called `fetch_html_data` in the code snippet above. `fetch_html_data` function is found in the `scripts/scraper.py` package which has been imported into the notebook as `scraper` in the import block defined above. 

Referring to the code snippet above, we employ the `fetch_html_data` function via `scraper.fetch_html_data(web_address)` since it belongs to the imported module `scraper`.

The `fetch_html_data` is expounded below:
```python
def fetch_html_data(web_address):
    try:
        # print(f"\nFetching data from {web_address}...")
        res = req.get(web_address)
        return res
    except req.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print('Stopped:', e)
    except TypeError as e:
        print('Stopped:', e)
```

The HTML data response is then passed into a function that converts it into a beautiful soup object. 

Importantly, the html data to soup object converter function is found in the imported `scraper` module. Therefore, it's utilized in the scraping for loop above via `scraper.convert_web_data_to_beautiful_soup_obj(web_data)`.

The `convert_web_data_to_beautiful_soup_obj` function is expounded below:
```python
def convert_web_data_to_beautiful_soup_obj(web_data):
    try:
        # print("Creating BeautifulSoup object...")
        soup_obj = BeautifulSoup(web_data.text, "html.parser")
        # print("Success! Object created!")
        return soup_obj
    except Exception as e:
        print("Stopped:", e)
```

The page's beautiful soup object is then passed into another function in which the appropriate HTML element selects all products in the page and loads them into a list. 

Looping through all the page's products list, the required data attributes are scraped from each product and are loaded into a dictionary. 
Below is the `append_one_product_details_dictionary_to_list` function:
```python
all_products_list = []

def append_one_product_details_dictionary_to_list(pg):
    # print(f"Appending page {pg} products' details to array")
    
    page_products_details_soup = soup.find_all("article", class_="prd _fb col c-prd")
    
    for detail in page_products_details_soup:
        details_dict = {"name": detail.find("h3", class_="name").text.strip(),
                        "new_price": detail.find("div", class_="prc").text.strip(),
                        "old_price": detail.find("div", class_="old").text.strip() if detail.find("div", class_="old") else None,
                        "discount": detail.find("div", class_="bdg _dsct _sm").text.strip() if detail.find("div", class_="bdg _dsct _sm") else None,
                        "rating": detail.find("div", class_="stars _s").text.strip() if detail.find("div", class_="stars _s") else None,
                        "votes": detail.find("div", class_="rev").text.strip() if detail.find("div", class_="rev") else None}
        all_products_list.append(details_dict)

```  

Each dictionary containing a product's details is then appended into a master list in the last line: `all_products_list.append(details_dict)` (in the code snippet above). The `all_products_list` (will/shall) contain the dictionaries of all the products, starting from the first page products through to the last page products. 

Remember after the for-loop is completed, the list of dictionaries are converted into a dataframe & then stored as a csv as previously discussed.  


### Data Preprocessing

The attributes of the raw acquired data acquired may require cleaning before the data analysis process. 

**NB:** For supplementary information on this preprocessing stage, please consult the data analysis notebook found in `notebooks/1_jumia_webscrape.ipynb` then run the cells in sequence.  

Firstly, read the csv file that was stored earlier to get a pandas dataframe:
```python
# Read csv and specify index column to prevent creation of another redundant index
products_df = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/all_products_list_raw.csv', index_col=0)  # Read products list from csv
```
Secondly, check the summary info of the data attributes as shown below:
```python
products_df.info()
```
The info summary of the data attributes obtained via `products_df.info()` is as below: 
```python
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Index: 2000 entries, 0 to 1999
Data columns (total 6 columns):
 #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype 
---  ------     --------------  ----- 
 0   name       2000 non-null   object
 1   new_price  2000 non-null   object
 2   old_price  1907 non-null   object
 3   discount   1907 non-null   object
 4   rating     109 non-null    object
 5   votes      109 non-null    object
dtypes: object(6)
memory usage: 109.4+ KB
```
The summary above indicates the necessity for preprocessing the data. Although the data has 2000 rows, it's clear that some rows have a high count of null values i.e., rating and votes while old_price and discount have a small count of the same. 

Another point of concern is that all columns have the object/string data type yet we know that's not the ideal scenario. More specifically, all columns save for name should be numeric. 

Therefore, the two fundamental areas of concern in the preprocessing stage are imputation (replacing missing values), and changing the column data types to their ideal types. However, there may be other minor points of concern that might require attention during the cleaning process - so an open mind is key to the process. 

#### Cleaning all relevant columns before imputing any null values
1) **Cleaning the ***new_price*** column**:

From the summary, the *new_price* column has no null values since it has a non-null count of 2000 while the dataframe has 2000 rows. 

- Firstly, remove the 'Ksh' prefix from the new_price values (e.g.: KSh 854) and by splitting the value at the space character and returning the second value (at position 1 of the 3 split values). The condition for this operation is that the row cell should not be null and value should be a string (to prevent the split from occuring during a notebook re-run when the new_price values are already in float format):
```python
# Remove currency denotation 'Ksh' 
products_df['new_price'] = products_df['new_price'].apply(lambda x: x.split(' ')[1] if x is not None and isinstance(x,str) else x) 
```
- Now running `products_df['new_price'].head()`, some new_price values (thousands) have commas in them (e.g.: 21,506). Therefore, this comma needs to be removed. The condition for the comma removal is that it must be present in the value and the value must be a string i.e., should not yet have been converted to float: 
```python
# Remove comma from thousands price values
products_df['new_price'] = products_df['new_price'].apply(lambda x: x.replace(',','') if ',' in x and isinstance(x,str) else x)
```
- The next step is converting the data values to float. Here, the condition for the conversion function is skipping the null values and performing a type conversion of the rest:
```python
# Convert new_price column to float
products_df['new_price'] = products_df['new_price'].apply(lambda x: float(x) if x is not None else x)
```
Checking the datatype of this column using `print(products_df['new_price'].dtype)` reveals that the data type is now `float64`.

- The final step in cleaning the *new_price* column is saving the progress in a csv file from where the next step's dataframe shall begin: 
```python
# Saving stage one (new_price) data cleaning file to csv
products_df.to_csv("../data/processed/1_all_products_new_price_cleaned.csv")
```

2) **Cleaning the ***old_price*** column**:

From the dataframe summary above, this attribute has only 93 null values (1907 non-null value count against a total count of 2000 rows).

- Firstly, create a dataframe from the csv created in preprocessing stage 1:
```python
# Read csv file cleaned in the previous stage (new_price column) & convert to dataframe
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/1_all_products_new_price_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```
- Check unique values in this column to inform the data cleaning decisions:
```python
# Use [:10] notation to print the first 10 values
products_df['old_price'].unique()[:10]
``` 
As was the case with the *new_price* column, the values here have a currency name, thousands values have commas, and nulls equally exist. 

- Therefore, removing the kenyan currency name 'Ksh' in the prefix of the data value. The condition is that the value shouldn't be null and the value must be a string (for reasons explained above in a similar step): 
```python
# Remove currency name 'Ksh'
products_df['old_price'] = products_df['old_price'].apply(lambda x: x.split(' ')[1] if x is not None and isinstance(x,str) else x)
```
- Now removing commas from thousands values. The condition is that the value shouldn't be null and the value should be a string: 
```python
# Remove commas from values
products_df['old_price'] = products_df['old_price'].apply(lambda x: x.replace(',','') if x is not None and isinstance(x,str) else x)
```
- Now convert the string values into floats (where values are present): 
```python
# Now convert the string values into floats
products_df['old_price'] = products_df['old_price'].apply(lambda x: float(x) if x is not None else x)
```
A confirmation with `print(products_df['old_price'].dtype)` returns `float64`. Hence the conversion from string to float is successful. 

- Now save the dataframe cleaned thus far into a new csv file like below: 
```python
# Saving stage two data (old_price column) cleaning dataframe to csv
products_df.to_csv("../data/processed/2_all_products_old_price_cleaned.csv")
```
3) **Cleaning the ***discount*** column**:

From the dataframe summary info, the *discount* column has a similar number of null values as the *old_price* column - 93 nulls (1907 non-nulls vs 2000 counts). 

- Read the csv file saved in the previous preprocessing/cleaning step to obtain a dataframe:
```python
# Read csv file from stage 2 (old_price column cleanup) to get dataframe
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/2_all_products_old_price_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```
- Check for unique values to inform the cleaning steps to take: 
```python
# Use [:10] notation to print the first 10 values
products_df['discount'].unique()[:10]
```
Running the above reveals there're 2 key types of data number percentages in string format (e.g. 34%) and null values. 

- Therefore, the first step is removing the percent sign at the suffix of the string values. The condition for removal is the value shouldn't be null and it should be a string:
```python
# Remove the percent sign
products_df['discount'] = products_df['discount'].apply(lambda x: x.replace('%','') if x is not None and isinstance(x,str) else x)
```
- Now the next step is converting the non-null string values into floats: 
```python
# Convert values into float & divide by 100 to represent the percentages as decimal values
products_df['discount'] = products_df['discount'].apply(lambda x: float(x)/100 if x is not None else x)
```
The percentages are converted to floats with a hundredths place value to ensure easier calculations later. 

- Saving the stage 3 preprocessed dataframe to a csv: 
```python
# Saving stage three data cleaning file to csv
products_df.to_csv("../data/processed/3_all_products_discount_cleaned.csv")
```

4) **Cleaning the ***rating*** column**:

From the summary info above, the rating column has a significant fraction of null values (109 non-null values vs 2000 rows, hence approx. 1891 nulls).

- The first step is reading csv file created at the end of stage 3 data cleaning to create a dataframe:
```python
# Read file cleaned in prior stage (discount column) to get dataframe
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/3_all_products_discount_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```
- Now check for unique values in that column: 
```python
# Check for unique values first
products_df['rating'].unique()[:10]
```
When unique values in the column are sought using the command above, the pattern appearing uniquely is `4.3 out of 5`. However, it's important to remember that nulls still exist although they don't appear in this list. 

- Now beginning the cleanup, the rating string with a format `4.3 out of 5` is split at the spaces into 4 elements with the first element (which holds the actual rating) being preserved. The condition for the split and selection is that the value should not be null and should be a string: 
```python
# Split rating string values into 4 elements and select the first element unless its None(left as is)
products_df['rating'] = products_df['rating'].apply(lambda x: x.split(' ')[0] if x is not None and isinstance(x,str) else x)
```
- Next, the non-null values in the rating column are converted into float: 
```python
# Convert the values into float
products_df['rating'] = products_df['rating'].apply(lambda x: float(x) if x is not None else x)
``` 
The string to float conversion is successful since `print(products_df['rating'].dtype)` shows that the column data type is now `float64`. 

- Now this stage's cleaned dataframe is saved into a csv file: 
```python
# Saving stage four data cleaning file to csv
products_df.to_csv("../data/processed/4_all_products_rating_cleaned.csv")
```

5) **Cleaning the ***votes*** column**: 
The *votes* column has a similar number of non-null values as the rating column since they are tied together. A vote is what creates a rating. The high number of null values (1891) in this column shall be imputed in the coming preprocessing/cleaning stages as is the case with nulls in the other columns. 

- First step is creating a dataframe from the saved csv file in the previous data cleaning stage: 
```python
# Read csv file saved in prior cleaning stage (rating column) to obtain dataframe
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/4_all_products_rating_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```
- Check the unique values in the column: 
```python
# Explore unique values
products_df['votes'].unique()[:10]
```
The results show a pattern such as this `4.7 out of 5(636)`. As in rating column cleaning, it's critical to recollect that nulls still exist in the column even if not part of this list. 

- Now split the value at the left bracket and again at the right bracket and select the votes value in between. The condition this split & select operation is that row should be non-null and should be a string. After selecting the votes string value, it's then converted to a float: 
```python
# Extract the votes count with string manipulation methods & convert values to floats
products_df['votes'] = products_df['votes'].apply(lambda x: float(x.split('(')[1].split(')')[0]) if x is not None and isinstance(x,str) else x)
```
- Save the dataframe cleaned to this juncture into a csv file: 
```python
# Saving stage five data cleaning file to csv
products_df.to_csv("../data/processed/5_all_products_votes_cleaned.csv")
```

6) **Imputing NULL values in the different columns**:

- First, get dataframe from the stage 5 cleaning: 
```python
# Read csv file from prior cleaning (votes column) to get dataframe
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/5_all_products_votes_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```
- Check all the nulls in the various columns:
```python
print(f"new_price nulls: {products_df.new_price.isnull().sum()}")
print(f"old_price nulls: {products_df.old_price.isnull().sum()}")
print(f"discount nulls: {products_df.discount.isnull().sum()}")
print(f"rating nulls: {products_df.rating.isnull().sum()}")
print(f"votes nulls: {products_df.votes.isnull().sum()}")
```
Running the above returns the values: 
`new_price nulls: 0
old_price nulls: 93
discount nulls: 93
rating nulls: 1891
votes nulls: 1891` respectively. So the next step is to start filling out the nulls.

- **Filling null values in *discount* column.**:
```python
# Use discount column average to fill nulls
products_df['discount'] = products_df['discount'].fillna(round(products_df['discount'].mean(), 2))
```
Running `products_df.discount.isnull().sum()` now returns 0 showing no null values present. 

**NB:** The null values in the discount column are imputed first since the column's average shall be used in imputing the nulls in the old_price column.

- **Filling null values in *old_price* column based on the product of the adjacent new_price value and the discount column average**:
Remember that the new_price column has no nulls hence it's applied in this imputation without further cleaning. 
```python
def multiply_fill_old_price_column_nulls(row):
    new_price = row['new_price']
    discount_column_mean = round(products_df['discount'].mean(), 2)
    
    if not pd.isna(row['old_price']):
        return row['old_price']
    return new_price * discount_column_mean
        
products_df['old_price'] = products_df.apply(multiply_fill_old_price_column_nulls, axis=1)

```
Running `products_df.old_price.isnull().sum()` returns 0 showing that the imputation is successful. 

- **Filling null values in *rating* column with mean/average of this same *rating* column:**
```python
products_df['rating'] = products_df['rating'].fillna(round(products_df['rating'].mean(), 2))
```
After the imputation above, checking null values with `products_df.rating.isnull().sum()` returns 0.

- **Filling null values in *votes* column with average of this same *votes* column:**
```python
products_df['votes'] = products_df['votes'].fillna(round(products_df['votes'].mean(), 2))
```
Again, running `products_df.votes.isnull().sum()` confirms 0 null values. 

With that, the data preprocessing is complete. This can be confirmed by running `products_df.info()` which returns the summary info below: 
```python
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Index: 2000 entries, 0 to 1999
Data columns (total 6 columns):
 #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------     --------------  -----  
 0   name       2000 non-null   object 
 1   new_price  2000 non-null   float64
 2   old_price  2000 non-null   float64
 3   discount   2000 non-null   float64
 4   rating     2000 non-null   float64
 5   votes      2000 non-null   float64
dtypes: float64(5), object(1)
memory usage: 109.4+ KB
```
- With all the columns cleaned, the dataframe is saved into a final preprocessed data csv: 
```python
# Saving stage 6 (null values imputation) data file to csv
products_df.to_csv("../data/final/6_all_products_all_columns_cleaned.csv")
```
- Finally, the cleaned dataframe is assigned a new name, `products_clean_df` to denote a cleaned dataframe: 
```python
# Read csv of the final data into dataframe
products_clean_df = pd.read_csv("../data/final/6_all_products_all_columns_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```


7) **Using Gemini AI to generate product category column values in an experimental dataframe**:

It's possible to analyze the scraped data relying on the existing data attributes. However, it's critical to create a new attribute called `product_category` to make the upcoming analysis and visualization more comprehensive.

Working from known to unknown, the `name` column will serve as a basis for predicting the `product_category`. 

The strategy is to feed a large language model (LLM) API with product names consecutively as part of custom instructions as the prompt, then use the response (predicted category) to populate the` product_category` column appropriately. 

The LLM chosen at the point of project creation was Google's GEMINI since it provides free API calls as long as they do not exceed 60 requests per minute (rpm).

Steps to employ in the product category prediction process: 

- First, slice the main dataframe `products_df` to create a smaller dataframe (the sliced one below is named `new_experiment_df` with only 20 rows). The snippet below shows the slicing: 
```python
experiment_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/6_all_products_all_columns_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
new_experiment_df = experiment_df.iloc[0:20]
new_experiment_df
``` 
- The aim of `new_experiment_df` is to create a proof of concept in predicting the product categories in a small dataset before moving on to predict the product categories for the entire 2000 products `products_df`. The code for the making predictions on the `new_experiment_df` is shown below. However, further clarification is provided below the snippet.  
```python
# Reload the gemini api call module, 'gemini_call', to refresh/reload it before use to prevent any unusual errors
importlib.reload(gemini_call)

- The code snippet above has been commented to provide more context. However, it's critical to provide more explanation on the code line linked to the API call, that is, `predicted_category = fetch_product_category(name_of_product)`. This code line first calls the `fetch_product_category(product_name)` function which makes the actual call to the Gemini API script which is found in `scripts\gemini_api_call.py` and has been imported into the notebook as `gemini_call`. Once all the rows in the `product_category` column of the `new_experiment_df` have been populated successfully, the dataframe is saved into a csv file and then printed. 

- It's necessary to quickly show how the `gemini_api_call` script works and some quirks involved. Below is the script: 
```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai
from google.generativeai.types import HarmCategory, HarmBlockThreshold
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load the .env using the dotenv(python-dotenv) package
load_dotenv()

# Pass api key to the genai client
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY_2"))


def predict_product_category(name_of_product):
    # Define the prompt with product category constraints (as categorized on jumia.co.ke)
    prompt = """
        I have this product name: "{}" 
        Predict the product category of the above product name from among the following options:
        Computing, Electronics, Sporting Goods, Garden & Outdoors, Musical Instruments, Phones & Tablets, 
        Toys & Games, Fashion, Pet Supplies, Home & Office, 
        Automobile, Health & Beauty, Baby Products, Industrial & Scientific

        """.format(name_of_product)

    # More: https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting_gemini
    # Define safety settings
    safety_settings = {
        HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE
    }

    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
    response = model.generate_content(prompt, safety_settings=safety_settings)
    return response.text

``` 
- From the above Gemini script, the first action is importing the required libraries (already included in the `requirements.txt` file save for operating system libraries). 
- The `load_dotenv()` function loads the `.env` file which holds the Gemini API key which is then loaded into the Gemini's `genai` client. 
- python-dotenv library very critical for securing the API keys and you find read it's documentation [here](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv).
- Now moving into the prediction function `predict_product_category(name_of_product):`, notice how the multiline string prompt provides a method to pass in in the name of the product. Next, safety settings for the Gemini client are defined (these settings are curious since there are some adult products sold on the website and if the blocking threshold is not set to `BLOCK_NONE`, the model will return Null for the said products). The nulls on some predicted values was noted on running the prediction function for the first time on the 2000 row dataframe, hence the addition of the `safety_settings`. 
- Note that right below the `products_df.info()` cell that's after the generation of product categories for 2000 products, there's a code markdown cell named `Checking rows with nulls in the product_category column` which shows that there were nulls in the said column the first time prediction run. `Filling product_category nulls with GEMINI api call with safety set to minimum (Ensure response not blocked)` and `Confirm rows with missing product categories have been filled` also highlight attempts dealing with the nulls in the `products_df`. However, they have been commented out since the safety setting solves this problem the first time the 2000 row prediction runs.  
- Finally, the client is defined before the prompt & the safety settings are passed into its generate_content function for a response to be generated. 


8) **Using Gemini AI to generate product category values for the actual products_df dataframe**:
Given that the LLM data generation proof of concept has worked in the previous step 7, it's time to run predictions on the 2000 row `products_df` dataframe. 

- The first step in this endeavor is loading a dataframe from the CSV created in the step 6 of the data cleanup. Comments are provided to aid understanding.
However, once the process is successful, the dataframe is saved into a CSV to ensure that the 2000 requests API call is made only the first time and then data is retrieved from the CSV file subsequently.  
```python
# Read csv where all columns are cleaned before fetching product categories for all 2000 product names
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/6_all_products_all_columns_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
```
After reading the dataframe, its product names are applied in generating product categories for the `product_df`:
```python
# Reload the gemini api call module, 'gemini_call', to refresh/reload it before use to prevent any unusual errors
importlib.reload(gemini_call)

# Function to call the LLM API script and get the predicted product category
def fetch_product_category(product_name):
    # Timed the API roundtrip during testing to find the average time...
    # ... to check if it's possible to surpass the set rate limit of 60 requests per min (RPM)...
    # ... besides, while doing the average time testing, I put a 1.2 sec sleep timer...
    # ... as the last line function as initial guard to ensure 50RPM aren't exceeded (60 secs/1.2 secs)
    start_time = time.time()  # Roundtrip timer start
    predicted_product_category = gemini_call.predict_product_category(product_name)
    end_time = time.time()  # Roundtrip timer stop
    durations_list.append(end_time - start_time)  # Append roundtrip time value to list

    return predicted_product_category

# Only run the API call to create product_category column & fill it if it's not yet created...
# ... this means that it makes the 2000 API calls once and saves the dataframe with predicted product categories for subsequent retrievals
if not os.path.exists('../data/processed/8_products_df_with_product_category.csv'):
    durations_list = []  # Store api roundtrip times to be used in calculating average time during test
    # for loop to run through all the dataframe rows
    for idx, row in products_df.iterrows():
        name_of_product = row["name"]  # Get current row's product name
        
        predicted_category = fetch_product_category(name_of_product)
        
        # If the 'product_category' column hasn't been inserted, insert it at index_col 1 after 'name' column
        if 'product_category' not in products_df.columns:
            print(f"{name_of_product} = {predicted_category}")
            products_df.insert(1, "product_category", predicted_category)  # Insert new column 'product_category' at index_col 1 & insert 1st value
        else:
            print(f"{name_of_product} = {predicted_category}")
            products_df.at[idx, "product_category"] = predicted_category  # Assign subsequent predicted categories to their corresponding idx positions
    
    # Save the dataframe with product categories into csv to avoid making expensive api call
    products_df.to_csv("../data/processed/8_products_df_with_product_category.csv")
    # print(products_df)
    print(f"\nNumber of API calls made: {len(durations_list)}")
    
    # Print average duration of API call
    average_api_call_roundtrip_time = sum(durations_list)/len(durations_list)
    print(f"The AVERAGE API call roundtrip TIME is: {average_api_call_roundtrip_time}")

products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/8_products_df_with_product_category.csv", index_col=0)
products_df.head(20)
```
- Confirm, that all rows in `product_category` have been filled: 
```python
products_df.info()
```

9) **Saving the products_df into the data/final folder & denoting it clean**
- After all the 8 steps are completed, extract the final dataframe from the `data/processed` folder to the `data/final` folder: 
```python
# Read csv of the final processed data folder into dataframe
products_df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/8_products_df_with_product_category.csv", index_col=0)
products_df.head()

# Save the cleaned dataframe as a CSV in the final data folder
products_df.to_csv("../data/final/products_df_all_cleaned.csv")
``` 
- After that, denote the `products_df` as clean before starting out on the data analysis section: 
```python
# Rename the products_df to products_clean_df before the data analysis section
products_clean_df = pd.read_csv("../data/final/products_df_all_cleaned.csv", index_col=0)
products_clean_df.head()
```
